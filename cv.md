## English language skills 
Upper Intermediate (B2)  

I was in love with a comic books and animation. Most of my fav stories was only in English or just looked and sounded better in the original. So I have no choice. A lot of time after I met some friends who was also native speakers from another countries. We had the face-time calls on the weekends so I had a lot of time to improve my skills just a bit. Now half of information(memes, articles, youtube videos and etc.) which I consume in English.
